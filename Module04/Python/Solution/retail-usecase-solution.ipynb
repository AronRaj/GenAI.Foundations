    "# Last-Mile Delivery Optimizer with LangGraph\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a sophisticated **Last-Mile Delivery Optimizer** using **LangGraph** and **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** to create an intelligent delivery management system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Case Overview: Last-Mile Delivery Optimizer\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Challenge\n",
    "Last-mile delivery is one of the most complex and expensive parts of the supply chain. It involves:\n",
    "- **Dynamic Route Planning**: Real-time optimization based on traffic, weather, and delivery priorities\n",
    "- **Customer Communication**: Proactive updates about delivery status and ETAs\n",
    "- **Priority Management**: Handling high-value orders, time-sensitive deliveries, and customer complaints\n",
    "- **Real-time Adaptation**: Responding to delays, traffic incidents, and customer requests\n",
    "\n",
    "### RAG Components\n",
    "Our system pulls information from multiple data sources:\n",
    "- **📅 Delivery Schedules**: Current routes, delivery windows, and driver assignments\n",
    "- **🚦 Traffic Data**: Real-time traffic conditions, road closures, and optimal routes\n",
    "- **💬 Customer Feedback**: Recent delivery reviews, complaints, and special requests\n",
    "- **📊 Historical Data**: Past delivery performance, common delay patterns, and optimization opportunities\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agentic Behavior\n",
    "The system acts autonomously to:\n",
    "- **🔄 Dynamic Replanning**: Automatically adjusts routes based on real-time conditions\n",
    "- **⚡ Priority Optimization**: Identifies and prioritizes high-value or delayed orders\n",
    "- **📱 Customer Communication**: Generates and sends proactive ETA updates and delay notifications\n",
    "- **🎯 Performance Optimization**: Learns from past deliveries to improve future routing\n",
    "\n",
    "## What We'll Build\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll create two different approaches:\n",
    "1. **Custom LangGraph Delivery System**: A manually constructed workflow with specialized delivery tools\n",
    "2. **ReAct Delivery Agent**: A reasoning-and-acting agent for complex delivery scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Technologies Used\n",
    "- **LangGraph**: For building stateful, multi-step delivery workflows\n",
    "- **Azure OpenAI**: For embeddings and chat completion\n",
    "- **Vector Search**: For semantic retrieval of delivery data\n",
    "- **Memory/Persistence**: For maintaining delivery context across sessions"

    "- **Dynamic Routing**: Different paths based on the type of delivery issue\n",
    "- **State Management**: Maintains context throughout the optimization process\n",

      "\n",
      "3. **Special Handling Requirement**:\n",
      "   - Train Sarah on fragile package handling for **555 Hill Dr**, and ensure signature confirmation for high-value parcels like **123 Main St**.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Post-Day Assessment**:\n",

      "Here is a comprehensive action plan addressing the current delivery crisis on Route 101:\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Key Issues:**\n",
      "1. **Route 101 severely delayed:** An accident on I-5 has blocked two lanes, causing a 25-minute delay.\n",
      "2. **High-value deliveries impacted:** Packages with values up to $400 are now delayed, increasing risk of complaints and loss of business.\n",
      "3. **Customer complaint from 789 Pine Rd:** The customer is angry over late delivery and has threatened to cancel future orders.\n",
      "4. **Relocation of Packages:** Route 101 deliveries may need reassignment to Route 102 while maintaining efficiency and priority.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Action Plan:**\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **1. Route Optimization**\n",
      "- **Immediate Rerouting:**\n",
      "  - For deliveries near Pine Rd, use **I-405** instead of I-5. Saves up to **20 minutes**.\n",
      "  - Avoid Highway 99 due to construction delays (15 minutes). Alternate streets or neighborhood routes should be used if applicable.\n",
      "- **Delivery Timeline Adjustment for Route 101:**\n",
      "  - Reassign the **789 Pine Rd delivery** from Route 101 to Route 102, provided Mike Chen has capacity and can reach Seattle by 3 PM. This preserves high-priority delivery.\n",
      "- **Add Backup Vehicles:** \n",
      "  - Consider deploying another vehicle for Route 101 deliveries to address stops 4 and 5 later in the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **2. Customer Communication:**\n",
      "- **Proactive Notification:**\n",
      "  - Immediately inform the customer at **789 Pine Rd** about the delay due to traffic. Offer sincere apologies and explain that the delivery will be prioritized in the alternate route.\n",
      "  - Offer a **discount or loyalty credit** to retain the customer after their complaint.\n",
      "- **Real-Time Tracking:**\n",
      "  - Activate SMS updates for **high-value deliveries** ($200+) on both Route 101 and Route 102 to keep customers informed about driver ETA.\n",
      "- **Custom Preferences Handling:** \n",
      "  - Ensure all special requests (e.g., call ahead for customers working from home, handling fragile items, signature confirmation) are addressed properly.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **3. Performance Improvements**\n",
      "- **Historical Analytics Usage:** \n",
      "  - Use the data highlighting that proactive SMS updates increase satisfaction by **25%**.\n",
      "  - Schedule **start times 30 minutes earlier** going forward to mitigate delays and improve customer satisfaction for high-value deliveries.\n",
      "- **Driver Efficiency**:\n",
      "  - Assign an experienced driver from Route 102 (Mike Chen) to assist with Route 101 delivery overflow. Historical data indicates Route 102's **strong performance metrics** (92% on-time rate).\n",
      "  \n",
      "#### **4. Contingency Planning**\n",
      "- **Weather Backup Routes:** Light rain forecasts for Seattle may impact driving speeds and timing by ~10%. Ensure alternate routes (e.g., neighborhood routes) are ready if traffic worsens on major arterials.\n",
      "- **Evening Peak Traffic Preparation:** Expect longer travel times (30% increase) between 4 PM and 6 PM. Prioritize high-value deliveries earlier in Mike's schedule and reschedule low-priority deliveries outside rush hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Timelines & Action Assignments:**\n",
      "1. **Immediate (Next 1 hour):**\n",
      "   - Notify customers at **789 Pine Rd** and other impacted stops of delays and estimated new delivery times.\n",
      "   - Re-route Route 101 via I-405 and Alaskan Way bypass for improved efficiency.\n",
      "   - Confirm driver availability (Mike) for reassignment tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Within 2-3 Hours:**\n",
      "   - Start priority delivery reassignment to Route 102.\n",
      "   - Begin real-time SMS notifications for affected customers.\n",
      "   - Offer discounts or credits as customer retention measures.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **End of Day (Today):**\n",
      "   - Ensure all deliveries, including stops 4 and 5 (Route 101), are completed via backup vehicle assignment if necessary.\n",
      "   - Provide detailed updates to the operations team on delivery status and customer feedback.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Follow-Up (Tomorrow):**\n",
      "   - Conduct a review of today's issues and lessons learned for prevention in the future.\n",
      "   - Ensure optimization strategies (earlier start, weather contingency) are implemented immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Outcome Goals:**\n",
      "- Deliver all packages on time or with acceptable delays (<60 minutes) using Route 102 reassignment where possible.\n",
      "- Prevent escalation of customer complaints at **789 Pine Rd** and other high-value stops.\n",
      "- Maintain company reputation through transparency and proactive customer communication.\n",
