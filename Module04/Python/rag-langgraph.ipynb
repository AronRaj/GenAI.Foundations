    "# LangGraph Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to build sophisticated RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems using **LangGraph** - a powerful framework for building stateful, multi-actor applications with large language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is LangGraph?\n",
    "LangGraph is a library for building stateful, multi-step applications with LLMs. It extends LangChain with graph-based workflows that can:\n",
    "- **Maintain State**: Preserve context across multiple steps\n",
    "- **Conditional Logic**: Make decisions based on intermediate results\n",
    "- **Tool Integration**: Seamlessly incorporate external tools and APIs\n",
    "- **Memory Management**: Handle conversation history and persistence\n",
    "\n",
    "## LangGraph vs Traditional RAG\n",
    "- **Traditional RAG**: Simple pipeline (Query → Retrieve → Generate)\n",
    "- **LangGraph RAG**: Stateful workflow with conditional paths, tool calls, and memory\n",
    "\n",
    "## What We'll Build\n",
    "We'll create two different RAG systems:\n",
    "1. **Custom LangGraph RAG**: A manually constructed graph with explicit state management\n",
    "2. **ReAct Agent**: A pre-built agent that uses Reasoning and Acting patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts Covered\n",
    "1. **MessagesState**: LangGraph's built-in state for managing conversation history\n",
    "2. **Tools**: Functions the LLM can call to retrieve information\n",
    "3. **Conditional Edges**: Dynamic routing based on LLM decisions\n",
    "4. **Memory/Checkpointing**: Conversation persistence across sessions\n",
    "5. **Graph Visualization**: Understanding workflow structure\n",
    "6. **Multi-turn Conversations**: Handling follow-up questions with context"

    "This section handles the secure loading of API credentials for Azure OpenAI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Task:\n",
    "Set up environment variables for Azure OpenAI API access.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "1. Import required modules:\n",
    "   - `load_dotenv` from `dotenv` (loads environment variables from .env file)\n",
    "   - `getpass` (for secure password input)\n",
    "   - `os` (for environment variable access)\n",
    "2. Call `load_dotenv()` to load environment variables from a `.env` file if present\n",
    "3. Check if `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` exists in environment variables\n",
    "4. If not found, prompt the user securely: `os.environ[\"AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass(\"Enter your Azure OpenAI API key: \")`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security Best Practice:** \n",
    "- Never hardcode API keys in code\n",
    "- Use environment variables or secure prompts\n",
    "- Works both locally (with `.env` file) and in production (with system environment variables)\n",
