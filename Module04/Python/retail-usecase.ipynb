    "# Last-Mile Delivery Optimizer with LangGraph\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a sophisticated **Last-Mile Delivery Optimizer** using **LangGraph** and **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** to create an intelligent delivery management system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Case Overview: Last-Mile Delivery Optimizer\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Challenge\n",
    "Last-mile delivery is one of the most complex and expensive parts of the supply chain. It involves:\n",
    "- **Dynamic Route Planning**: Real-time optimization based on traffic, weather, and delivery priorities\n",
    "- **Customer Communication**: Proactive updates about delivery status and ETAs\n",
    "- **Priority Management**: Handling high-value orders, time-sensitive deliveries, and customer complaints\n",
    "- **Real-time Adaptation**: Responding to delays, traffic incidents, and customer requests\n",
    "\n",
    "### RAG Components\n",
    "Our system pulls information from multiple data sources:\n",
    "- **📅 Delivery Schedules**: Current routes, delivery windows, and driver assignments\n",
    "- **🚦 Traffic Data**: Real-time traffic conditions, road closures, and optimal routes\n",
    "- **💬 Customer Feedback**: Recent delivery reviews, complaints, and special requests\n",
    "- **📊 Historical Data**: Past delivery performance, common delay patterns, and optimization opportunities\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agentic Behavior\n",
    "The system acts autonomously to:\n",
    "- **🔄 Dynamic Replanning**: Automatically adjusts routes based on real-time conditions\n",
    "- **⚡ Priority Optimization**: Identifies and prioritizes high-value or delayed orders\n",
    "- **📱 Customer Communication**: Generates and sends proactive ETA updates and delay notifications\n",
    "- **🎯 Performance Optimization**: Learns from past deliveries to improve future routing\n",
    "\n",
    "## What We'll Build\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll create two different approaches:\n",
    "1. **Custom LangGraph Delivery System**: A manually constructed workflow with specialized delivery tools\n",
    "2. **ReAct Delivery Agent**: A reasoning-and-acting agent for complex delivery scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Technologies Used\n",
    "- **LangGraph**: For building stateful, multi-step delivery workflows\n",
    "- **Azure OpenAI**: For embeddings and chat completion\n",
    "- **Vector Search**: For semantic retrieval of delivery data\n",
    "- **Memory/Persistence**: For maintaining delivery context across sessions"
